# Access Code 2.2 Final Project Proposal

**Project Name:**
The Poseidon Project

**Team Name:**
Poseidon Team

**Team Members:**  
* Fatima Villanueva (Kaira)
* Jamaal Sedayao
* Natalia Estrella
* Daniel Distant

## The Problem 

Mobile gaming has exploded in the past few years, but the majority of games in the App Store do not encourage users to move or be active at all. This results in increased health challenges for children and adults

* Thanks to our technological lifestyle, 45 percent of 16 to 24-year-olds suffer from back pain – a 60 per cent rise from last year, according to The British Chiropractic Association

* “Text neck” was coined recently to describe the aches in the head, neck and shoulders from tilting the head forward for long amounts of time. “Text claw,” a term created to describe soreness and cramping in the fingers, comes from repeated fine motor activity like playing Candy Crush or Clash of Clans, according to CNN Health

* “Inactivity leads to obesity, and it means risk of cardiovascular disease is greatly increased.” -- Orthopedic surgeon Jonathan Dearing

## The Solution 

* ZitchRun (working title) combines the zany fun of mobile gaming with the exhilaration of the outdoors to create a unique user experience

* ZitchRun encourages users to run, jump, hide, and dodge their friends – its fun minus the sedentary style of other games

* Demo 1 features: Have two devices connect (Multipeer connectivity). Actions done on one screen will the affect other connected devices

*  Bonus features: Gyroscope heavy features. This will help users further engage in the game 

## Market Research

* Mobile gaming has exploded in the past few years, especially on the iPhone. 94 million iPhones are in use in the U.S. as of March 2015, according to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners

* It’s estimated that the mobile gaming industry reached $25 billion in sales in 2014. That’s almost double (42%) over 2013, eMarketer reported

* Time spent playing mobile games has increased, even while time spent playing video games and computer games has reached a plateau. The average time spent playing in a typical day has increased 57 percent to over two hours per day in 2014 versus one hour and 20 minutes in 2012, according to a 2014 study done by The NPD Group

* It’s estimated that the mobile gaming industry reached $25 billion in sales in 2014. That’s almost double (42%) over 2013, eMarketer reported

* The average age of today’s gamer: 31. Only 29% of gamers are under 18, but 74% of teachers K-8 use digital games in the classroom, according to BigFishGames

* Competition: MonkeyMojoGames, Fitsy for iOS, Mob Action Games (early stages), Wii Fit, Wii Sports, PlayStation Move, Xbox Kinect

* Our **targeted user** could be as young as 10 but as old as 35, so ZitchRun needs to be accessible to all ages. Users need this app to have quick, active fun

## Execution 

* 11/1 – 11/7 – Research CoreBluetooth, CoreLocation, Multipeer Connectivity, GameKit, iBeacon, Augmented Reality and any other necessary technologies and decide what will go into building ZitchRun. Cement ideas for the app

* 11/8 – 11/14 – Work on MVP: a user can run up to another user and their phone will react, telling them when they’re far, in medium range and nearby

* 11/15 – 11/21 – Perfect the MVP: users can tag users and infect them with the Zitch, users’ phones’ react to tagging/being tagged, handsets react when out of range, users can connect to the same game through MPC

* 11/22 – 11/28 – Add new features like map, UI/UX improvements, music, tag notifications, animations, timer options, post-round statistics

* 11/29 – 12/5 – Add modes: Manhunt, Freeze, Single Player (AR?), work on presentation, debug

* 12/6 – 12/8 – Work on presentation, debug
